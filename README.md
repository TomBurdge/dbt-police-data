# Police Stop and Search Data.
This repo uses dbt, duckdb, and polars to download the latest stop and search data in the UK.

This project involves:
- Data I find interesting and important.
- An exploratory project on DBT.

Typically, as with this project, I like to explore tools such as DBT through *doing* after a very quick use of the example projects provided in documentation.
